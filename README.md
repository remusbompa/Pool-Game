# Pool-Game
Built a 3D pool game in C++ with OpenGl library.  The project consists of implementing a classic “8 Ball Pool” game with 2 players, who use 7 red balls, 7 yellow balls, a black ball and a white ball.

In the file Tema2EGC you can find the full description of the project.

The entire project (including the OpenGL framework) can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UelXAjikFtQOkWAB5haWePp33OG5cWwd).
